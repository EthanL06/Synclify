<h2 align="center">openW2G</h2>

<p align="center">The aim of openW2G is to enable two users to sync any kind of streaming service playback by simply sharing a room code similar to how <a href="https://w2g.tv">w2g.tv</a> works.
openW2G is an ad-free open-source browser extension that syncs user's clicks in their browser through a websocket.<br/>
<strong>The project is currently in early development so bugs are to be expected.</strong></p>
